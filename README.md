# JobFit-AI 🚀  
*Automated Resume Relevance Check System*

## 📌 Problem Statement
At **Innomatics Research Labs**, resume evaluation is currently **manual, inconsistent, and time-consuming**. Each week, the placement team across Hyderabad, Bangalore, Pune, and Delhi NCR receives **18–20 job requirements**, with each posting attracting **thousands of applications**.  

Currently, recruiters and mentors manually review resumes against job descriptions (JD), leading to:  
- ⏳ Delays in shortlisting candidates.  
- ❌ Inconsistent judgments (different interpretations of requirements).  
- 🏋️ High workload for placement staff, reducing focus on student interview prep.  

With hiring companies expecting **fast and high-quality shortlists**, there is a pressing need for an **automated, scalable, and consistent system**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The **Automated Resume Relevance Check System** aims to:  
1. Automate resume evaluation against job requirements at scale.  
2. Generate a **Relevance Score (0–100)** for each resume per job role.  
3. Highlight **missing skills, certifications, or projects**.  
4. Provide a **fit verdict** (High / Medium / Low suitability).  
5. Offer **personalized improvement feedback** to students.  
6. Store evaluations in a **web-based dashboard** for recruiters.  

---

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. **Job Requirement Upload** – Placement team uploads job description (JD).  
2. **Resume Upload** – Students upload resumes (PDF/DOCX).  
3. **Resume Parsing** – Extract raw text, normalize, and structure sections.  
4. **JD Parsing** – Extract role title, must-have & good-to-have skills, qualifications.  
5. **Relevance Analysis**  
   - 🔹 **Hard Match** – keyword & skill check (exact + fuzzy).  
   - 🔹 **Semantic Match** – embedding similarity (LLM-powered).  
   - 🔹 **Weighted Scoring** – combine hard & soft matches.  
6. **Output Generation**  
   - Relevance Score (0–100).  
   - Missing skills/projects/certifications.  
   - Verdict (High / Medium / Low suitability).  
   - Suggestions for student improvement.  
7. **Storage & Access** – Results stored in DB; recruiters can filter/search.  
8. **Dashboard** – Web app for placement team to manage results.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Core Resume Parsing & AI
- **Python** – primary language  
- **PyMuPDF / pdfplumber** – PDF parsing  
- **python-docx / docx2txt** – DOCX parsing  
- **spaCy / NLTK** – entity extraction, text normalization  
- **LangChain / LangGraph** – orchestration of LLM workflows  
- **LangSmith** – observability & debugging  
- **Vector Store** – Chroma / FAISS / Pinecone  
- **LLMs** – OpenAI GPT / Claude / Gemini / Hugging Face models  
- **Keyword Matching** – TF-IDF, BM25, fuzzy matching  
- **Semantic Matching** – embeddings + cosine similarity  

### Web Application
- **Backend** – FastAPI / Flask  
- **Frontend** – Streamlit (MVP), optional React for production  
- **Database** – SQLite (MVP) / PostgreSQL (production)  

---

## 📊 Scoring Logic
- **Hard Score (HS)** – keyword & skill match (must-have > good-to-have).  
- **Soft Score (SS)** – semantic similarity (embeddings + LLM).  
- **Final Score** = `0.55 * HS + 0.45 * SS`  

**Verdict Thresholds**  
- 🔥 High: ≥ 75  
- ⚡ Medium: 50–74  
- ❌ Low: < 50  

---

## 🗄️ Database Schema (simplified)
- **users** – placement team / students  
- **jds** – job descriptions & metadata  
- **resumes** – student resumes & parsed text  
- **evaluations** – score, verdict, missing items, suggestions  
- **embeddings** – vector representations for semantic search  

---

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/jobfit-ai.git
